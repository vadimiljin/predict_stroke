    "Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Project. Here, I delve into a fascinating journey of data exploration with the aim of identifying those at a higher risk of experiencing a stroke. The process is akin to a detective's work: thorough, precise, and driven by the desire to uncover hidden truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey starts with Exploratory Data Analysis, a deep dive into the dataset to find patterns and correlations. Next, I cleanse and standardize the data, preparing it for effective utilization in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through visualizations, I then transform raw numbers into illustrative graphics, shedding light on trends within the data. The final step involves building machine learning models, trained to recognize patterns and make predictions about stroke risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is simple yet crucial: to determine key factors contributing to stroke risk and provide actionable insights. This project draws from the promising field of medical computing, considering various health factors to refine the models and improve stroke predictions.\n",

According to the data retrieved from the website of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aka \"[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/getting-tested.html)\", patients with glucose levels below 100 mg/dL are determined to be healthy, while those with glucose levels between 100-125mg/dL are considered at risk. Patients with glucose values measured above 126 mg/dL are diagnosed as diabetic. It is worth mentioning that different types of glucose tolerance tests can yield varying results indicative of patient illness, although no information was given on which specific test(s) were used for dataset inclusion.\n",

Although high, this amount of glucose can still occur within a human body, therefore it cannot be classified as an actual outlier. Instead, this result must be considered as a possible test outcome. Since fasting blood sugar tests are primarily used for screening purposes, while glucose tolerance tests are more specialized, it is assumed that the dataset provides information solely on the former test type."

Heart disease can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the brain and causing a stroke. People with heart disease should work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their condition, including controlling high blood pressure, managing cholesterol levels, and making lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and eating a heart-healthy diet to help reduce their risk of stroke."

    "Our dataset records patients as young as under one year old, with the oldest being 82. The average age of individuals within the dataset is 42 years. Observing glucose levels, we notice a range from 50 to 275. This range indicates two prominent peaks: one around the value of 90, corresponding to normal glucose levels, and the other around 220, typically associated with diabetes. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) recorded is 28.9. The lowest BMI in the dataset is 10.3, while the highest is 97.6, a value that suggests a potential outlier given that BMI is generally expected to be under 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis of the data, age emerges as a significant factor in stroke risk. Additionally, elevated glucose levels may also hint at a greater likelihood of experiencing a stroke. The influence of BMI on stroke probability appears less pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other variables that could play a substantial role in stroke risk include self-employment status, a history of hypertension or heart disease, and marital status. However, it's crucial to note that the dataset is significantly skewed. Out of 5110 individuals, only 249 have experienced a stroke, which may potentially bias our conclusions."

    "Making a decision on which classifier to use in a classification task is crucial. In my case, I considered several models before settling on `XGBoost`.

In machine learning, the best_score_ attribute refers to the highest achieved score or performance metric of a certain model during cross-validation. Cross-validation is a method used to determine how well a machine learning model can generalize when given new data that it has not seen before."

    "\n",
    "After working with the Stroke dataset, I found that the XGBoost model was the best fit for predicting strokes. Here are the optimal parameters I used for this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subsample: 0.5\n",
    "- Number of Estimators: 100\n",
    "- Maximum Depth: 3\n",
    "- Learning Rate: 0.01\n",
    "- Column Sample by Tree: 0.7\n",
    "- Column Sample by Level: 0.6\n",
    "- Scale Positive Weight: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of performance, my model was pretty good at identifying both stroke and non-stroke cases. When it came to identifying stroke cases (the positive class), it had a precision of 14.13% and a recall of 85.48%. For non-stroke cases (the negative class), the precision was 99.17% and the recall was 77.02%. Overall, the model's accuracy was 77.38%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model showed that certain factors were especially important in predicting strokes, including a person's age, their average glucose level, whether they're married or not, their smoking status, and whether they have hypertension or heart disease. This information could really help doctors figure out who's most at risk of a stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that this Stroke dataset was a bit tricky to work with because it was imbalanced - there were way more samples of one class than the other. I tried a couple of strategies (upsampling and downsampling) to address this, but in this case, they didn't really improve our model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to diagnosing illnesses, it's crucial that we get it right. We don't want to miss anyone who's sick, but we also don't want to tell someone they're sick when they're not. A good diagnostic model can also help hospitals run more smoothly, by helping to determine how long patients need to stay, reducing the need for unnecessary tests, and ultimately, saving costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing a model that tries to catch all true positives while minimizing false positives, I've aimed to reduce diagnostic errors as much as possible. While no model is perfect, I believe my strikes a good balance and I help doctors make better decisions when diagnosing strokes."
